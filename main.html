        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sagardip Debnath, a passionate and curious mind constantly exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. My journey began in the classrooms of Umakanta Academy, where I developed a deep fascination for problem-solving and innovation. Fast forward to today, I’m pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Cloud Computing and Automation, where I aim to build scalable, efficient systems that can make an impact.

            Driven by the belief that learning never stops, I’m always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. Whether it's coding my way through complex algorithms, building dynamic web applications, or diving into the world of automation, I find joy in the process of creation.
            
            When I'm not writing code or studying tech trends, you'll find me exploring new books, gaming, or thinking of ways to merge my technical skills with creativity. The future is full of exciting possibilities, and I can’t wait to be part of shaping it.</p>
